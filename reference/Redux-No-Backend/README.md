# front_end_mvp_improved

front-end project refactored as clean and functioning

# I WILL NOT BE USING YARN!!!

please keep this in mind while you attempt to review and critique this project.

I just don't believe in yarn and for the most part, everything that WAS bad about NPM has now been repaired.
And, going forward I would like to refactor this entire project in TS and that would not be possible with yarn,
that I am aware of. At the very least, it would surely limit my future endeavors of following along with someone
else, to learn new concepts.
This will have 3 stages to it, and many things will be refactored as things change and improve.
